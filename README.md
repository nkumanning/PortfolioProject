Data Analyst
------------

I have been learning data analytics for a year. I have been trying to change my career from a teacher to a data analyst. At Montgomery College, I took a course in Data Analyst Practitioner where I learned how to use SQL, Python, and Power BI. Currently, I am taking a course to study for CompTIA Data+ certification exam.
